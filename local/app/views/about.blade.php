						<p>Great question. Here at Lawyer Friend, we are all about friendship and sharing, and we believe that anyone who wants to be friendly and social should be able to reap the rewards, which is why we have come up with tiered Friend Levels, allowing you to advance from “Friend” to “Good Friend” to “Great Friend” to “Best Friend”, all by accruing points on our website, which you can earn by fully updating your account profile, and most importantly, by sharing website content on your social networks. The more complete your profile and the more content you share, the more points you will earn and the higher your Friend Level will go!</p>


						<h3>Did You Say I Could Lower My Legal Fees?</h3>
						<p>We totally did. All legal services offered via Lawyer Friend will always have fixed prices, so there will never be any confusion regarding the rate you will pay, and you want to know what’s even better? The best part is-- the higher your Friend Level, the LOWER your rates for services will be! That’s right, you can actually save money on legal fees for the services you need from lawyers you can trust by simply increasing your Friend Level! Become our friend today and start saving!</p>
